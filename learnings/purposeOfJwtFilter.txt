The purpose and mechanism of .addFilterBefore(jwtAuthFilter, UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter.class):

The UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter is Spring Security's default filter that handles form-based authentication - it processes username/password authentication requests typically submitted through login forms.
Here's why we place our JwtFilter before it:

Filter Order Significance:

javaCopy.addFilterBefore(jwtAuthFilter, UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter.class);

This means: "Hey Spring, run my JWT filter BEFORE you would normally run the username/password filter"
It's critical because we want to check for JWT tokens first before attempting any form-based authentication

====================================================================================================

Default Filter's Role:

javaCopypublic class UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter extends AbstractAuthenticationProcessingFilter {
    public static final String SPRING_SECURITY_FORM_USERNAME_KEY = "username";
    public static final String SPRING_SECURITY_FORM_PASSWORD_KEY = "password";
    // ... rest of the implementation
}

This filter by default processes POST requests to /login
Looks for username/password in form data
Attempts authentication using these credentials


====================================================================================================
====================================================================================================
Practical Example of Flow:

plaintextCopyRequest → JwtFilter → UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter → ... → Controller

If JWT valid:
   JwtFilter authenticates → UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter is skipped
If no JWT:
   JwtFilter passes → UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter processes form login

====================================================================================================
====================================================================================================

Why This Order Matters:

javaCopy// In JwtFilter
if (authHeader != null && authHeader.startsWith("Bearer ")) {
    // Process JWT authentication
    // If successful, no need for username/password authentication
}

If we have a valid JWT, we don't want to process username/password authentication
The JWT authentication should take precedence
Once authentication is set in the SecurityContext, subsequent filters won't attempt to re-authenticate
