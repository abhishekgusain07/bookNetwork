1. servelet.multipart.max-file-size
    servlet.multipart.max-file-size: 50MB

    Sets the maximum size of a single file that can be uploaded
    In this case, files larger than 50 megabytes will be rejected
    If a user tries to upload a 51MB file, they'll get a MultipartException

2. springdoc
    default-produces-media-type: application/json specifies that all API endpoints by default will produce JSON responses
    This affects the OpenAPI documentation and Swagger UI
    When someone calls your API endpoints, the response will have Content-Type: application/json header

3. server.servlet.context-path
    This sets up the base URL path for your entire application:

    context-path: /api/v1/ means all your endpoints will be prefixed with /api/v1/
    For example:

    If you have @GetMapping("/users"), the actual URL will be /api/v1/users
    If you have @PostMapping("/auth/login"), it becomes /api/v1/auth/login
